Redhat wants to predict the business value of its customers
This project tries to create a classification algorithm that accurately identifies which customers have the most potential business value
based on their characteristics and activities.
Below are the data available:
  people.csv	
  sample_submission.csv	
  act_test.csv
  act_train.csv
Need to perform necessary pre-processing before applying any algorithm.
In this case, Random forest is used to predict the outcome.
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted and the observed outcome.
Necessary software: Python 2.7, Scikit learn, Pandas, Numpy
